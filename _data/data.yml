    summary: |
      He obtained a dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Electronic
      Engineering from the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU)
      in 2019 and the M.Sc. in Advanced Electronic Systems from the
      same university in 2021. He is currently working as a PhD
      candidate in the Engineering Physics program within the
      Department of Electronics Technology at the University of the
      Basque Country (UPV-EHU). His interests lie in image
      processing, computational intelligence (data mining,
      artificial neural networks, convolutional networks), and
      embedded software-hardware co-design in PSoCs for advanced
      driver assistance systems.

          "Hyperspectral Image Processing with Application
          to Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous Driving Systems". The
          thesis project investigates the use of spectrometric
          sensors to enhance and strengthen detection and
          classification algorithms for various objects on the
          road. The study has two main objectives: First, it
          aims to determine to what extent the rich spectral
          information provided by snapshot-type hyperspectral
          cameras can improve the robustness of these systems.
          Second, it explores whether a rapid initial
          segmentation of images based on spectral information,
          supported by machine learning techniques, can
          drastically simplify the complex processing sequence
          required for object detection. If successful, this
          technique should enable the development of more compact
          and efficient processors (System on a Chip, or SoC) for
          real-time object detection in Advanced Driver Assistance
          Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).
      - degree: MSc in Advanced Electronics Systems

        time: 2019 - 2021
        details: |
          The main objective of the MSc's in Advanced Electronic
          Systems is to equip students with the necessary skills
          for integrating electronic devices, computers, and
          communication technologies in the research and
          development of innovative electronic systems with
          multiple applications: communications, advanced control,
          signal processing, data acquisition and measurement
          systems, embedded vision, computational intelligence,
          etc. The Master's Thesis project is as follows:
           - "Study on the Applicability of Deep Networks to
          On-Chip Multispectral Image Segmentation for Autonomous
          Driving Systems". This project investigates the
          potential contributions of fully convolutional networks,
          as opposed to techniques based solely on spectral
          information, to hyperspectral image segmentation for
          advanced driver assistance systems. Specifically, it
          involves working with a U-Net trained on weakly labeled
          databases, meaning databases that do not contain all
          labeled pixels. Additionally, since images are obtained
          using a snapshot-type camera, particular attention is
          paid to preprocessing these images to generate
          hyperspectral cubes.

          The Double BSc in Physics and Electronic Engineering
          trains students as professionals in engineering with a
          strong scientific component and as professionals in
          physics with a significant technological component. It
          provides the ability to conceive, design, and produce
          electronic equipment and systems, utilize mathematical
          techniques, and collaborate with professionals in
          related technologies. Additionally, it enables the
          acquisition of new knowledge and the application of
          emerging technologies in the fields of electronics and
          physics. The Bachelors's Thesis projects have focused
          on the following aspects:
          Los Trabajos de Fin de Grado han
          versado sobre los siguientes aspectos:
          - Electronic Engineering: "Implementation of a
          neuro-fuzzy system on FPGA for characterizing driving
          styles." This project involves modeling the driving
          styles of various drivers using machine learning
          techniques to personalize their response to adaptive
          cruise control under tracking conditions.
          Subsequently, a high-speed implementation of the
          model is carried out on an FPGA.
          - Physics: "Advanced Photonic Technology in
          Automotive: Photometry and Geometric Optics for
          Raindrop Detection on Windshields." This project
          begins with a state-of-the-art review of current
          applications of photonic technology in various
          Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in
          automobiles. Then, it delves into RIGSEC: a raindrop
          validation algorithm on windshields based on their
          optical and photometric properties. Fundamentals and
          advanced aspects of digital image processing are
          studied and applied to this algorithm
